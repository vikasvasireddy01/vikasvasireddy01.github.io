 I am an experienced software engineer with expertise in software engineering and machine learning. I have a proven track record in designing, developing, and scaling microservices, as well as integrating advanced messaging systems and APIs for enhanced data analytics and system performance. 
  Currently, I am a graduate assistant at Arizona State University, focusing on computing on AI and ML. Previously, I worked at Cisco, where I managed the daily dispatch of millions of messages and engineered solutions that significantly improved system responsiveness and scalability.
  On this website, you can learn more about my skills, experience, and interests, and get in touch with me to discuss potential opportunities or collaborations.

          Developed 'ConnectX', leveraging MongoDB and Cassandra to build a distributed database solution for dynamic social networking platforms. Prioritizing scalability
          and fault tolerance, the project aims to optimize data handling and ensure reliable performance.. The key tools used in this project are:- <br>
                    - MongoDB<br>
                    - MySQL<br>
                    - DynamoDB<br>

          As an academic collaboration with Amazon Web Services Machine Learning Solutions, I enabled SHAPLey explanations for sequential recommender systems. Generating explanations 
                    for sequential recommender systems helps identify which events are important in determining the model recommendations. The key tools used in this project are:- <br>
                    - PyTorch<br>
                    - SHAP<br>
                    - Pandas<br>

          This is a group project where we collected SEC filings(Form 10k Item 7A) on ~1600 stocks as well as reddit posts on 28 subreddits regarding investing.
           We then perform sentiment analysis by using a pretrained HugginFace model. The key tools used in this project are:-.  <br>

        - Developed and implemented a text similarity model utilizing FuzzyWuzzy and Spacy to accurately map customers across three separate Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems with 70% accuracy replacing the manual approach.
        - Designed ETL pipelines for monitoring order statuses and tracking truck movements from distribution centers to stores. Developed a uniform schema across 12 tables, which resulted in 86% of orders being mapped to exact delivery times.
        - Designed a promotion effectiveness model that calculated key drivers of promotion, such as direct lift, halo and cannibalization at the item level. Escalated ~ 5% of promotions on a weekly basis.
        - Calculated optimal inventory levels and replenishment schedules for all SKUs by time series forecasting (FB-Prophet) and Linear Programming techniques (MIP on CPLEX) for better supply chain management.
